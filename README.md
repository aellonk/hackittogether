## True Blue For Good: Give Back with JetBlue
Winning prototype idea made for JetBlue's challenge to create a product that demonstrates how JetBlue is the most caring airline in the world. This was achieved by creating a feature for JetBlue's website that allows customers to browse volunteering opportunities that partner with the airline, offering rewards in the form of True Blue points.
